# Express-React-CMS-Admin

The administrator CMS in React for the Express-React-CMS package.

Future recommendations:

1. Alt-description tags for images - would need to set up a database to hold the alt tags and then call it for each image
2. Email formatting - allow admins to change style/formatting of emails
3. Dynamic content blocks that display depending on set URL params on front-end
